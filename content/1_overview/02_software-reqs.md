The software requirements for running the Marginalia Search Engine are:

* Linux, probably doesn't matter which distro, the instructions assume something Debian or Ubuntu-like.  If you're running something else, you're probably smart enough to figure it out.
* Docker ([install guides](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
* Docker Compose ([install guides](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Java 21 (use [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) to install)
