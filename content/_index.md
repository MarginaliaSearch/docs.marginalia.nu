This is the documentation for the Marginalia Search Engine Software.
The software is licensed under AGPL, and can be used to run an internet 
search engine.

The Marginalia Search Engine Software is an *Internet* search engine. 
This is to be understood as different from a general-purpose document 
search engine  like elasticsearch or mellisearch. An Internet search 
engine makes different assumptions about the nature of the data being 
indexded, and different concessions about performance and scaling. 

The Marginalia search engine is integrated with a crawler, and is 
designed to be used as a search engine for the internet, and is 
relatively poorly suited for use as a document search engine.

The software is simultaneously the backing sofware for the [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/) 
project, but can also been run in a barebones mode for use as a 
search engine backend for other projects.
